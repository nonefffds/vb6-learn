# Learning Visual Basic 6.0

What a year? Why still learning Visual Basic 6.0 at this point? Are you nut?

## Discreptiuon

This is a repository that will store my VB6.0 project files for the class.

Everything will be crappy, might-be buggy and probably dysfunctional.

If you are interested in this, you might wanna doing something else, baking a coffee bean might be a choice.

Overall, this is a non-private repo, for I just wanna show how crappy the code I can write.

## Context
